# Abstract
A fundamental problem in text analysis of great amount of information is to discover the topics described in the documents. One of the most useful application involves the extraction of topics from documents corpus. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model has been developed to carry out the task of automatically selecting the words of the corpus and, based on their frequency in the documents, it would indicate that they may or not belong to certain topic, classifying words without human intervention.
